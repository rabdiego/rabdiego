### `f'Hello, {visitor.get_user_name()}!'`

My name is Diego Rabelo, but you can call me **Nik**. I'm currently studying Computer Science at Federal University of Ceará (UFC).

I'm a big fan of AI and Machine Learning, and that is my focus on my career. I also find IoT and Computer Graphics pretty cool, even though those aren't my main interests.

Some other things I enjoy are:
- 🎸 Playing guitar
- 🚴‍♂️ Cycling
- 🎮 Nintendo games
- 🌊 Beaches
- ⚽ Football
